# IT-Project-Management

Capstone project for the Information Technology program where groups of undergrad students undergo a simulation of the Project Management Lifecycle for The Global Treps project. 

The prompt for the simulation is as such: "You have been selected as the project manager for the Global Treps Project. You helped to run a local shark tank like event at your college last year as part of a class project. So, you have gathered idea of what is involved. The schedule goal is six months, and the budget is $120,000. Your favorite professor is Dr. K., and a few of her associates have agreed to fund the project. Your strengths are your organizational and leadership skills. Your goal is to develop a fully functioning website and test it by holding four events in four different countries. Youâ€™ll make improvements to the site after those events, develop plans to scale it up, and recommend how to transition the project results into a successful business."

Attached is the final outcome of the project simulation and my contributions as an Associate Project Manager.
